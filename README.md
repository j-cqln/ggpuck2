# ggpuck2
Visualizing hockey with ggplot2

A collection of functions I use in efforts to make pictures of pucks & stats look pretty.

## Requirements
R, with these packages:
- dplyr
- reshape2
- ggplot2
- ggstar
- gridExtra
- pubtheme

Thanks to [Brian](https://github.com/bmacGTPM) for pubtheme and the rink plotting functionality.
